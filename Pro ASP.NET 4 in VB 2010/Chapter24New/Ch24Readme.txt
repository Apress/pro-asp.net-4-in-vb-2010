Chapter 24 Notes:

The ASPNETDB.MDF database is not included with the Chapter 24 website. This database, and the correct connection string to access it, will have to be created in a manner consistent with your installation.

For best results, copy the web pages individually to new website projects for testing. This avoids conflicting code in other pages.

The CustomProfileProvider application will not run until the stored procedures and database have been created using the ProfileProvider.sql procedure.
